# searcheveryword

A search project that does everyword things

If you're going to fork this, you'll need to create your own CSV file at `.data/archive.csv` (the database of tweets is not accessible to the public, sorry). That file should be CSV formatted, where each row has two values: first, a tweet ID; second, the word (or search term, whatever). Like this:

```csv
123,foobar
678,Ã©clair
```

Thanks bye!
